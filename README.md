EZ-Swap was designed to be an affordable tool-changer 3D printer for makers and hobbyists, due to the high costs of other toolchangers such as the E3D tool-changer and the Prusa XL. EZ-Swap is constructed from primarily 2020 v-slot aluminum extrusions with 3D-printed connector plates and has a build volume of 300mm x 300mm x 300mm. It uses a Core-XY motion system with smooth linear rods for the x-carriage and dual Z-lead screws. Eventually, EZ-Swap will utilize a belted Z-axis and have carbon fiber rods instead of conventional metal smooth rods for increased printing speed. The extruder assembly is almost entirely 3D-printed and utilizes a magnetic-lock kinetic coupler to swap extruders. Currently, a Ender 3-style MK8 hotend is being used, however, the design will be updated to use an E3D V6 type hotend. Changes will also be made in regards to the size of the extruder coupling in order accomodate more extruders while keeping the footprint of the printer relatively small. In addition, a CR-10 heated head is being used along with a magnetic PEI sheet. Options for using glass or garolite will be avaliable. The printer also uses 6 standard NEMA 17 stepper motors, however, plans are being made to use encoded stepper motors for greater accuracy. EZ-Swap is designed to run Klipper 0.12.0 firmware on the BIGTREETECH Octopus v1.1 main board with support for input-shaping.

EZ-Swap was heavily inspired from the E3D toolchanger and Jubilee printers. 

A prototype is currently being built and build progress will be uploaded to YouTube. Once a prototype is completed, all 3D files and firmware will be uploaded to GitHub.
